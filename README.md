# XciteClone

A clone website mirroring [xcite.com](https://www.xcite.com/) coded by me to test my MERN stack skills. Features:

- Fully Functioning Searchbar
- Carousels of Products
- Secure Signup and Login
- Dynamic Shopping Cart
- Responsive Site
- And much more!

I've tried to maintain the look and feel of the actual site as much as possible. Technologies used:

- Frontend - React.JS , Redux , Material-ui, Bootstrap
- Backend - Node.JS & Express.JS , JWT Authentication
- Database - MongoDB
- API Testing - Postman
- Deployment - Heroku
